									<span class="synopsis">
										<em>The recent news from a series of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports paints a gloomy picture of a world affected by climate disruption, with increasing risks driven by compounding and cascading climate hazards across natural and human systems, and difficult challenges in addressing the root causes of climate change. Even though the world is slowly – but surely – taking belated action to stop the climate emergency, much more tangible work is needed lest we end up with more paralysing “blah, blah, blahs” as Greta Thunberg notes; the outcome of which likely leads to a warming world well in excess of the Paris warming limits of 2 °C with disastrous consequences to the most vulnerable natural ecosystems and human populations. In this keynote, the speaker intends to focus on one blueprint to avert this outcome – that of climate resilient development – which leads to outcomes in which a sustainable transition of human systems occurs while keeping to warming to 1.5 °C. He will elaborate on what does such a development entail (e.g. on adaptation to climate risk, mitigation of climate emissions through behavioural and infrastructural changes, and a focus on sustainable development); on why it is needed urgently and extensively (e.g. how ad hoc approaches that do not include but exclude stakeholders that lead to maladaptation and mitigation failures from unintended consequences); and conclude by stressing that climate resilient development requires an inclusive approach in which youth delegates have an outsized role in both enabling and maintaining the sustainability impacts in the years to come.</em>

Referencing the Singapore Institute of Architects’ 7 EDGs (Environmental Design Guidelines), themselves adapted from the UN SDGs, the talk looks into a future where the built environment becomes a solution for, rather than a contributor to, climate change.</em>

We have always believed in providing an enabling environment where ecosystem stakeholders can come together to support innovation and drive food sustainability. Through collaboration, we can deliver maximum impact. This is even more so for lean start-ups who may not necessarily have the resources to scale on their own more than they would like to despite their know-how.</em>

										<em>The power of simple ground-up environmental initiatives driven by local eco-communities is often overlooked in favour of complex, scientific "smart solutions”. However, both natural and social sciences are necessary in building an effective solution that strives for ecological sustainability. This sharing presents the idea of common but differentiated local solutions towards solving the problem of global climate change, and also discusses other challenges: In what ways can we meaningfully engage an increasingly pluralistic society for collective environmental action? How do we create active allies for the environment out of passive ones, and even out of opposition actors? Navigating these social challenges can help progress sustainable development from the very baseline of any society, creating pathways to prosperity for both people and planet.</em>

								<strong>Mr. Jaime Ho</strong>
								<p>
									Partner,<br>Finsbury Glover Hering
								</p>
								<div class="synopsis-container">
									<span class="synopsis"><em>This session explores the diverse and growing challenges in addressing and communicating climate action. From fatalism to fatigue, to greenwashing and unfulfilled promises, the challenges to meaningful action will likely sharpen together with the real day-to-day threats of climate change to communities around the world. How best to identify and avoid these pitfalls? Is it possible to create broad-based societal movements on climate action, which can address long-standing issues such as climate justice, while avoiding the larger trends of polarisation in political debate today? What role will the youth of today play? This session will hope to provoke discussions on the necessary next steps forward.</em></span>

										<em>In this virtual talk, Diana Fu will talk about her experiences as a young person educating communities that have been marginalised by race, gender, and class to take power over the ecological situations that they face so that they can prosper collectively. Her nonprofit work has situated her as a teacher in Black, Latinx, and Asian American communities in the Bronx and the Bay Area, where she has also used her practice of creative writing and the arts to highlight how everyday experiences of ecology are central to ordinary people understanding what they can do for their own communities and their relationship to the natural environment. In her current position at the San Francisco Estuary Partnership, she enacts public projects that scale out her educational and environmental work in ways that connect California to the Pacific Rim.</em>

										<em>Debates surrounding climate change often involve an element of attributing blame for the state of the environment; often this blame is outward, with an (un)known “other” taking the fall for our declining condition. Several governments and NGOs have gone to great pains to emphasise the importance of individual responsibility for the environment, otherwise known as environmental or ecological citizenship. But how successful has this been in changing social behaviour and perceptions of responsibility? This presentation draws on some preliminary studies on social behaviour related to the management of electronic waste in Singapore, and posits that much more needs to be done to nudge people towards becoming active environmental citizens.</em>

It was opened last year to promote an interest and appreciation among the wider community on the diversity of wildlife in Singapore. As part of Gardens by the Bay’s latest sustainability efforts, more than 200 native mangrove trees and mangrove associates were planted as part of a pilot study to understand the potential for urban wetlands in storing “blue” carbon. Participants will get to enhance their visitor experience in the Gardens and discover the biodiversity and sustainability features of the Gardens through a pilot Augmented Reality tour.

										<em>Being sustainable is not as easy as ABC kind of task in Singapore. Having been into sustainability for the past 11 years, the speaker has faced many rejections in her life and discouragement about sustainability.  “You cannot save the earth.” “Why are you trying so hard?”. “It is for the next generation to worry about, not us.”These are phrases she encountered or you might have heard them yourself when you are trying your best to be sustainable and be in this low waste journey. Without a doubt, there is still so much to work on within Singapore's environmental scene and change is still a work in progress. Yes, sometimes it gets slightly depressing when you see all the climate disasters happening around us, with everyone not taking action. In her sharing, Joline will share her journey of how facing these obstacles led her to start The Sustainability Project and how she continues to overcome these obstacles.</em>
